 *****************************************************************************
 * Reactor API.
 * The reactor pattern allow to manage many asynchronous events
 *  within the same thread of processing.
 * This allow to process in the main function time and stack, events generated
 *  within interrupt code.
 * The events are prioritized such that the first handler that registers is
 *  always dealt with first.
 * This API is very simple, but deals with the complexity of atomically suspending
 *  the MPU in the main loop whilst processing interrupt outside of the interrupt
 *  context.
 * The interrupt do not need to hug the CPU time for long and simply notify the
 *  reactor that work is needed.
 * Therefore, all the work is done in the same context and stack avoiding
 *  nasty race conditions.
 * To use this API, simply register a handler with #reactor_register.
 * Then, if the main program needs to process the event, register a event handler
 *  using #reactor_register.
 * Finally, let the reactor loose once all the interrupts are up and running with
 *  #reactor_run.
